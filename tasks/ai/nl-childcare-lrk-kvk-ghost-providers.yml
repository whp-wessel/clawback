status: in-review

objective: >
  Cross-reference the Landelijk Register Kinderopvang (LRK) with KVK
  company data and BAG address registry to identify potential ghost
  childcare providers — LRK-registered providers whose KVK registration
  is dissolved/inactive, whose registered address does not exist in BAG,
  or where multiple providers share a single residential address.
  Ghost registrations may signal potential subsidy abuse in the
  kinderopvangtoeslag (childcare benefit) system.
