status: open

objective: >
  Analyze TenderNed procurement data (2023-2025) to measure vendor
  concentration per contracting authority. Identify authorities where
  a single vendor or small group of vendors captures a disproportionate
  share of contract value. High vendor concentration — especially when
  combined with frequent use of non-open procedures — may signal
  potential favoritism or inadequate competition.

evaluation:
  criteria:
    - HHI must be calculated correctly (sum of squared market shares)
    - Must distinguish between open, restricted, and negotiated procedures
    - Must control for authority size (small authorities naturally have fewer vendors)
    - Summary must include required disclosure disclaimer
