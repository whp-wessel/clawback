objective: >
  Cross-reference TenderNed contract winners with KVK company data and
  insolvency records to identify red flags: contracts awarded to companies
  that were insolvent at time of award, recently incorporated companies
  winning large contracts, companies with SBI codes mismatched to the
  contract category, or winners that subsequently went insolvent within
  12 months of award. These patterns may signal potential due-diligence
  failures or collusive arrangements.
