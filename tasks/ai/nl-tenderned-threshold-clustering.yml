objective: >
  Analyze the distribution of contract values in TenderNed data (2023-2025)
  to identify statistically unusual clustering just below EU mandatory tender
  thresholds (EUR 221,000 for services, EUR 5,538,000 for works). A spike
  in contracts valued at 90-99% of threshold may signal potential threshold
  avoidance. Produce a distribution analysis and flag anomalous clusters.

      Methodology, statistical tests used (e.g., McCrary density test),
      findings, and limitations. Must include required disclaimer.

evaluation:
  criteria:
    - Must analyze both the services threshold (EUR 221K) and works threshold (EUR 5.5M)
    - Must use a recognized statistical method to test for bunching
    - Histogram must clearly show the threshold boundary
    - Summary must include required disclosure disclaimer
