objective: >
  Compare DigiMV healthcare governance data between 2023 and 2024 to
  identify institutions with significant year-over-year changes in
  governance indicators — sudden board turnover, missing financial
  disclosures, or large unexplained revenue shifts. Cross-reference
  flagged institutions with the zorgaanbieders registry to verify
  registration status. Sudden governance deterioration may signal
  potential mismanagement or financial distress.
