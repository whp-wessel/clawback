# Realistic example: detect potential procurement splitting in Dutch municipal contracts
id: nl-procurement-splits

type: ai

status: open

objective: >
  Analyze Dutch municipal procurement data to identify potential contract-splitting
  signals — contracts that appear to be artificially divided to stay below mandatory
  EU tender thresholds (currently EUR 221,000 for general services). Flag clusters
  of same-vendor, same-category contracts awarded within short time windows that
  individually fall below the threshold but collectively exceed it.
