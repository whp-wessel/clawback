objective: >
  Analyze Dutch financial instruments data (2017-2024) to identify
  subsidies and grants with unusual growth patterns, sudden spikes in
  disbursements, or instruments where actual spending significantly
  exceeds or falls short of budgeted amounts. Rapid unexplained growth
  in a subsidy program may signal potential scope creep, eligibility
  gaming, or inadequate controls.
