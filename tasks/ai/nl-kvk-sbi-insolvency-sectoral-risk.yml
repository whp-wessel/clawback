objective: >
  Join KVK SBI (activity code) data with insolvency records to produce
  a sectoral insolvency risk map. Identify SBI sectors with anomalously
  high insolvency rates relative to their size. Sectors with extreme
  insolvency rates — especially in government-adjacent domains like
  healthcare, childcare, construction, and consulting — may warrant
  deeper investigation for potential subsidy-dependent business models
  or systematic abuse patterns.
