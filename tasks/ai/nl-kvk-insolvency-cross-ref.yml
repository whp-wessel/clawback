type: ai

status: in-review

objective: >
  Cross-reference the KVK company register with the Centraal
  Insolventieregister to identify companies that went insolvent shortly
  after incorporation, or companies with repeated insolvency patterns
  across related entities (same address, director name, or SBI code).
  These patterns may signal potential phoenix company behavior — where
  entities are deliberately wound up to shed debts and restarted under
  new registrations.
